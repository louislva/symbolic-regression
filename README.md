## Todo

- [x] Simple unstructured evolutionary algorithm to minimize loss
- [x] Render hierarchical representation to mathematical notation
- [ ] Make evolution a Monte Carlo Tree Search to increase performance
- [ ] Punish complexity somehow (e.g. `4 * x` is better than `2 * x + 2 * x`)
- [ ] Make web interface where you can input X and Y and watch it find you a function
